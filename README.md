# Consulting Project Logistic Regression


## Project Instructions (according to Udemy)

This is a personalized project proposed by Jose Portilla, which is a instructor of Udemy, as a part of the course "Spark and Python for Big Data with PySpark". 

## Binary Customer Churn

A marketing agency has many customers that use their service to produce ads for the client/customer websites. 
They've noticed that they have quite a bit of churn in clients. 
They basically randomly assign account managers right now, but want you to create a machine learning model that will help predict which customers will churn (stop buying their service) so that they can correctly assign the customers most at risk to churn an account manager. 
Luckily they have some historical data, can you help them out? 
Create a classification algorithm that will help classify whether or not a customer churned. 
Then the company can test this against incoming data for future customers to predict which customers will churn and assign them an account manager.

The data is saved as customer_churn.csv. Here are the fields and their definitions:

    Name : Name of the latest contact at Company
    Age: Customer Age
    Total_Purchase: Total Ads Purchased
    Account_Manager: Binary 0=No manager, 1= Account manager assigned
    Years: Totaly Years as a customer
    Num_sites: Number of websites that use the service.
    Onboard_date: Date that the name of the latest contact was onboarded
    Location: Client HQ Address
    Company: Name of Client Company
    
## Content of the files:

3. customer_churn.csv: labeled dataset containing customers which churned;
4. new_customers.csv: new dataset containing the companies to predict churn.
